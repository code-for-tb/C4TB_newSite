    <p>At the end of the weekend, the top award winner for our 2015 event was the <strong>Multi-cultural Visitor's Guide </strong>team. Our <strong>2nd place winner</strong> was the team that created an <strong>Emergency Preparedness Interactive Map</strong> and <strong>3rd place</strong> went to the <strong>Tampa Bay Trade and Protocol Council app</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>People's Choice Award </strong>was a tie, with equal appreciation and admiration for the <strong>Entrepreneur Collaboration Center App</strong> team and the <strong>Tampa Downtown Partnership Shuttle App</strong> team.</p>
    <p>Congratulations to these great teams and thank you for the time, 
     effort and skill you put into developing these truly useful and valuable
     resources for our community! And many thanks to our terrific judges who
     took the time to evaluate each entry carefully: Toni Aliberti, <a href="http://theironyard.com/locations/tampa-st-petersburg/">The Iron Yard</a>; Jan Broadwater, <a href="http://www.forexfactory.com/">Forex Factory</a>; Mike Cook, <a href="http://www.guidepointsecurity.com/">GuidePoint Security</a>; Sid Hassan, <a href="http://www.tekbank.net/">TekBank</a>; Ryan Negri, <a href="http://www.laicos.com/">Laicos</a>; Steve Willingham, <a href="http://eurekafactory.net/">Eureka!

    <p>Code for Tampa Bay Brigade is honored to have helped produce 
     Hillsborough County's 3rd Annual National Day Weekend! of Civic Hacking 
     event this year. We especially appreciated recognition for Code 
     for Tampa Bay's efforts to "provide a creative environment where 
     innovation thrives," by Commissioner Sandy Murman. </p>
    <p>The extensive front end work that went into identifying community 
     needs not only produced an A-list of really interesting and useful 
     challenges to kick off the weekend, but started the bigger 
     conversation of civic collaboration in our community that we plan to 
     continue all year long.  Code for Hillsborough participants 
     got a firsthand look at some real community needs and issues, and local 
     government met a hundred area technologists, programmers and developers 
     ready, willing and eager to share their skills and abilities for the 
     good of all.</p>
    <p>We got to hear from some great presenters on best practices in 
     everything from mobile development to the complexities of transparency. 
     We got to a better understanding of the challenges that face 
     government agencies in their day to day work, and we heard from citizens
     about the challenges they face trying to access services or resources. 
     And we learned to work together in new ways. </p>
    <p>One of the most amazing things about a Hackathon is the way it 
     inspires self-organized collabration among people who often are meeting 
     for the very first time. The challenges look daunting, especially 
     with a deadline of two days:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Make Florida Vendor Payment information accessible, useful and 
      understandable - and do it from these thousands of lines of raw data</li>
     <li>Find a way to help us understand our inmate populations and how our
      jail systems are being used from multiple sources of information</li>
     <li>Map out a shuttle transportation system for downtown Tampa</li>
     <li>Create a web application that provides 
      international matchmaking between foreign companies and 
      Hillsborough County </li>
     <li>Develop a multicultural visitor guide from basically a jpeg image and a brochure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and many others. And yet all these amazing people came together in 
     small collaborative groups to plan and execute solutions to the 
     challenges before them in just 2 days. This is evidence not just 
     of skill and talent, but of really decent people.</p>
    <p>We'll be sharing more stories from Code for HIllsborough 2015, as 
     well as "Where are they now?" updates on the projects developed at the 
    event.

We couldn't have done it without you!</p>
    <p> And a very special shout out to the fine county of 
     Hillsborough, especially to Economic Development Manager Jennifer 
     Whelihan, whose dedication and commitment, not to mention some
     super impressive organizational skills, are making a 
     powerful and enduring difference in the growing our community at all 
     levels.</p>

  <h2>Code for Hillsborough Day 1 Recap<br><small>May 2015</small></h2>
  
  
  <p>Wow!
   Day one of the 3rd Annual National Day of Civic Hacking event in 
   HIllsborough County was a winner start to finish! We kicked things off 
   with a great Friday night launch, and some early organizing, and 
   this morning, nearly 100 participants filled the main meeting room 
   at Microsoft. <a href="http://www.codefortampabay.org/pages/CodeforHillsborough" target="_blank"> Nine challenges </a>were offered, including the first ever statewide challenge, put forth by the <a href="http://www.myfloridacfo.com/sitePages/newsroom/pressRelease.aspx?id=4511" target="_blank">Florida Department of Financial Services</a>, to make state vendor payment information more transparent.</p>
  <p>Dave Finnigan, the Founding Director of the youth environmental education program, <a href="http://www.climatechangeiselementary.org/" target="_blank">Climate Change is Elementary, </a>trekked
   over from Orlando, as well, to pitch his idea about an educational app 
   to encourage local school children to be socially conscious consumers. 
   Dave's five minute pitch netted him an interested team, and all but one 
   of the other challenges got champions as well. (We noticed that 
  challenges with a lead champion on hand were picked up by teams). </span></p>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.codefortampabay.org/pages/CodeforHillsborough#911" target="_blank">9-1-1 educational app</a> went into the capable hands of the local <a href="http://www.codefortampabay.org/news/13" target="_blank">Tampa Bay Coder Dojo</a> group, an enthusiastic team of 8-12 year olds led by two great mentors and guided by Ira
   Pyles, of the Hillsborough County 9-1-1 Agency. The youth were on
   it immediately, working out a game plan and coming up with what is 
   essentially a simple simulation of an emergency (with a bear in a 
   burning house!) that walks children through the process of knowing when 
   to call 9-1-1 and what information to provide.  Coder Dojo students
   presented their project in the afternoon, and it was great! In a 
   little over four hours, they'd provided digital animation, voice overs, a
   story line and coding to produce a very viable app. And they're getting
   a field trip to emergency services, as well, to see the agency in 
   action and build on the learning they experienced today. </p>
  <p>We loved having a youth coding session as part of our National Day 
   event and plan to make it a regular part of Code for Hillsborough.</p>
  <p>After the youth presentation, we invited teams working on our other challenges to check in. </p>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.codefortampabay.org/pages/CodeforHillsborough#FloridaVendor">Florida Vendor Payments </a>challenge
   has proven - challenging! But a team of innovators, lead by an 
   awesome father-daughter duo who has been at both previous 
   hackathons, has taken it on and found a viable platform for 
   providing some useful visual representation of vendor payments. Can't 
   wait to see what their final product looks like tomorrow during presentations.</p>
   <img src="imgs/news/MakeThings.png" class="newsImgLeft">
  <p>The <a href="http://www.codefortampabay.org/pages/CodeforHillsborough#Jail">Jail Population Management app</a>,
   which Code for Tampa Bay Brigade founding member, Phil Muino, has been 
   championing since we started a year ago, found another supporter and the
   team of two - a citizen with a passion for making information visible 
   and understandable, and a coder with the skills to make it happen - 
   worked together all day to get a viable framework for managing the 
   wealth of data Phil's accumulated on the subject. The wait may be over, 
   Phil! Can't wait to see the management app tomorrow.</p>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.codefortampabay.org/pages/CodeforHillsborough#Multicultural" target="_blank">Multicultural Visitors Guide</a> project got a multicultural team of thinkers and doers to wrangle a 
   brochure into a useful application for guests to our remarkable and 
   diverse community. The <a href="http://www.codefortampabay.org/pages/CodeforHillsborough#Atlas">Hillsborough Community Atlas </a>project
   champion came with a simple request. A local resident, he wants 
   to be able to use the website easily to find the information he wants 
   about his community, including areas of greatest population density to 
   help determine where more
   libraries should be, to better serve citizens. The Atlas team is 
   confident of their efforts and should have a strong candidate during 
   presentations on Sunday.</p>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.codefortampabay.org/pages/CodeforHillsborough#Shuttle" target="_blank">Downtown Shuttle Challenge</a> drew a large, gregarious and intergenerational team interested in 
   helping the Downtown Partnership develop a viable dispatch and 
   circulation system for a local area shuttle system. They had a lot
   of drawings on the whiteboard that included Starbucks as a point of 
   departure but were were short on details during check in, saying only that, yes, they were working an app. What could it be?!</p>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.codefortampabay.org/pages/CodeforHillsborough#HillsboroughECC">Hillsborough Entrepreneur Collaborative Center </a>website
   experience team was rich with artists, and the ECC is well on its way 
   to having a beautiful and functional new resource for citizens 
   interested in making the best use of this spectacular public space.</p>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.codefortampabay.org/pages/CodeforHillsborough#TBTPC" target="_blank">Tampa Bay Trade and Protocol Council </a>team
   got a late but energetic start, when some late arriving participants 
   walked in and asked where they could help. We observed that two 
   projects didn't have teams, and since they had some familiarity with the
   TBTPC group, they set to work and made some great progress in a short 
   amount of time.</p>
  <p>It's been so exciting and heart warming to see the focus and dedication all these great civic change agents have brought
   to this year's Hack for Change event. It's also been fascinating 
   to watch how teams self-organize, naturally and in the total spirit
   of Code for America compassionate collaboration.</p>
  <p>People of all ages, writers, artists, technologies, entrepreneurs, 
   citizens, coders and noncoders, have come together for the amazing 
   experience of simply working together for a weekend of civic problem 
   solving. Whatever comes of the
   projects tomorrow, during afternoon presentations, the magic and the 
   impact has already happened. People have discovered one another, 
   found expression and voice, created new networks, neural and social, and
   have brought Hillsborough County that much further along the path of 
   collaborative, citizen engagement. </p>
  <p>We're very grateful to Hillsborough County, FL and all the great 
   event partners who have contributed food, and swag and expertise to our 
   NDoCH event, and especially to all those who have volunteered their time
   and skills to address the challenges before us, and embraced warmly and
   with enthuisasm,the opportunity to take them on.</p>
  <p>Tomorrow,doors open again at 9am, with breakfast at 9:30, and coding through early afternoon. Project presentations will be at around 3pm. </p>
  <p>There will be no losers though - we've all already succeeded!</p>

        <h2>Coder Dojo Students Join in Code for Hillsborough to Code for Greater Good!<br><small>May 2015</small></h2>
  <img src="imgs/CoderDojo.png" class="newsImgRight">
  <p><a href="https://coderdojo.com/" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a> is
   a global volunteer-run program to get kids excited about coding. 
   In the Tampa Bay Area, CoderDojo is run in close cooperation with the 
   public library system. Every few days, kids gather at public 
   libraries, accompanied by a parent, and are mentored by information 
   technology professionals from industry. Often kids who have gained
   some knowledge of coding are encouraged to help out in mentoring as 
   well! At <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/o/coderdojo-tampa-bay-area-3802215495" target="_blank">CoderDojo Tampa Bay Area</a>, we like to say that no money changes hands but tremendous wealth is being created in the community. </p>
  <p>At <a href="http://hackforchange.org/events/tampa-fl-national-day/" target="_blank">Code for Hillsborough</a><strong>,</strong> nearly 30 Coder Dojo students will join together to work on the <a href="http://www.codefortampabay.org/pages/CodeforHillsborough#911" target="_blank">9-1-1 Education challenge </a>to
   help create a website or application that gamifies the 
   concepts of 911 Services for younger audiences that would: </p>
   <ul>
    <li>Be similar to an online coloring book</li>
   <li>Be used during classroom and community outreach meetings</li>
   <li>Help portray 911 Services in a positive light so more people will be inclined to use them</li>
 </ul>
  <p>This is a great way for kids use 21st century skills to help other kids be safe and provide a useful service to their community.</p>
  <p>You can Coder Dojo Tampa via <a href="http://twitter.com/coderdojoTPA" target="_blank">twitter.com/coderdojoTPA</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CoderDojoTPA" target="_blank">facebook.com/CoderDojoTPA</a>,
   and more importantly, help out! If you're at Code for Hillsborough on 
   Saturday, be sure to spend a little time with these great young coders, 
   and consider becoming a Coder Dojo mentor!</p>

<h2>Code for Hillsborough Projects Galore!<br><small>April 2015</small></h2>
  
  <img src="imgs/news/Strategic.jpg" class="newsImgLeft">
  <p><a href="http://hackforchange.org/events/tampa-fl-national-day/">Code for Hillsborough</a>, our fine county's 3rd Annual <a href="http://hackforchange.org/" target="_blank">National Day of Civic Hacking</a> event, is chockablock with civic challenges to explore, and we need all hands on deck to make the most of the opportunities before us! </p>
  <p>Anyone can participate; you don't have to be an expert in technology,
   you just have to care about your neighborhood and 
   community. Everyone from coders to designers to community 
   organizers and peopel with a passion for making our community better are
   invited to join together with Hillsborough County staff to look at both
   local and statewide community improvement projects. </p>
  <h4>Event Goals</h4>
  <p>The idea of the event is to come up with some solid real 
   time solutions to the needs and challenges listed below, or others 
   you may be interested in exploring or developing.  Completing apps
   or projects during the weekend is great, but not necessary. Proof
   of concept applications with well developed frameworks are just as 
   important, and will be considered equally with completed projects as 
   potential solutions that can be built out further in the days and weeks 
   after our event. </p>
  <h4>Florida State Vendor Payments Statewide Challenge</h4>
  <p>One project we're joining in with <a href="http://codeformiami.org/" target="_blank">Code for Miami Brigade</a> and others is the first ever <a href="http://codeformia.tumblr.com/post/119358078347/ndoch-statewide-civic-hacking-challenge" target="_blank">NDCH Statewide Challenge</a> in collaboration with our <a href="http://www.myfloridacfo.com/Transparency/">CFO Jeff Atwater</a>, six years (2009-2014) of vendor payment data will now be made <a href="http://flair.dbf.state.fl.us/dispub2/newvpymt4.shtml" target="_blank">available for download</a>.
   With this data, technologists, designers, data visualizers, and 
   anyone interested in exploring for potential insights can go forth
   and query. Play with the data and make something interesting or 
   informative, creativity is encouraged. You can use tools like 
   fusion tables, D3.js, tableau, plotly, or any other source tools to 
   create interactive visualizations of payments over time that 
   can show which vendors contract with state agencies, what type of 
   work is being done, or which areas where state business concentrates. </p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   
  <h3>Local Projects</h3>
  <p>Here's a short list of other potential projects:</p>
  <img src="imgs/news/SaveDate.jpg" class="newsImgRight">
  <h4>Hillsborough County Entrepreneur Collaborative Center (ECC) Website Enhancement</h4>
  <p>The ECC is intended to serve as a 
   convenient, central location and depository for potential, or 
   existing, entrepreneurs amd small business to discover resources of
   local non-profit partners and to receive financial and technical 
   information. The ECC provides free, individual, and confidential 
   consulting, workshops, seminars, and general information on marketing, 
   getting businesses online, using QuickBooks, SBA loans and 
   programs, bookkeeping, local government vendor applications, the bidding
   process, Minority/Women Certification forms, vendor directories, and 
   more.  Enhancements needed include </p>
   <ul>
  <li>Improved site and services description</li>
  <li>Partner links and services provided</li>
  <li>Schedule of Events</li>
  <li>On-site registration for events, appointments and meeting space reservation</li>
  <li>Ability to create database from registrants</li>
  <li>Downloadable brochure</li>
  <li>Contact Us</li>
  <li>ideo</li>
  <li>Tour of ECC</li>

  </ul>
  <h4>Multicultural Visitors Guide to Hillsborough County</h4>
  <p>The county seeks a dedicated multicultural guide to the area, preferrably as a mobile app, which:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Links to Visit Tampa Bay (HC Convention and Visitors Bureau CVB) and Visit Florida (state tourism office)</li>
   <li>Includes a map interfaced with Google, pinpointing venues </li>
   <li>Ideally features a walking trail or driving route to link sites and return</li>
   <li>PRovides background history of each venue/site, perhaps utilizing archival photos/video</li>
   <li>Possible audio of text/copy about venue or directions.</li>
   <li>Is easy to update with new sites in county and in nearby counties </li>
   <li>Possible applet for visitor to take a selfie or shot, send to 
    friends, family maybe with a “frame” or Postcard greeting option that 
    can be shared on social media</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>9-1-1 Educational App</h4>
  <p>The county would like to create a website which gamifies the concepts of 911 Services for younger audiences that would: </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Be similar to an online coloring book </li>
   <li>Be used during classroom and community outreach meetings</li>
   <li>Help portray 911 Services in a positive light so more people will be inclined to use them</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Young coders from <a href="https://coderdojo.com/news/2013/11/21/coderdojo-tampa/" target="_blank">Coder Dojo Tampa </a> are joining us on Saturday to help with this project! More on this great group in an upcoming post.</p>
  <h4>Traffic Forecasting App</h4>
  <p>This idea, suggested by Phil M., a 
   high school student member of our Code for Tampa Bay Brigade, 
   incorporates historical traffic data and local road conditions and
   information, with Google Maps real time traffic data to 
   "forecast" what can be be expected on different routes on different days
   or times of day. Elements that can be taken into consideration 
   include:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Trend data </li>
   <li>Events</li>
   <li>Construction </li>
   <li>Incidents</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Jail Population Management Dashboard</h4>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/jail-population-management-dashboard/" target="_blank">Jail Population Management Dashboard</a> is
   intended to helps local law enforcment &amp; judicial communities
   understand the occupancy within the county jail system. This 
   application can be created through <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/in-n-out" target="_blank">adaptation of app code from City of Louisville, KY</a> and consists of a simple dashboard view to let agencies see:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>How many people are in jail </li>
   <li>How long have they been there </li>
   <li>Release data</li>
   <li>Historical booking and incarceration data</li>
   <li>Possible options to incarceration</li>
   <li>Rates of recividism</li>
  </ul>
  <p>and more.</p>
  <p>Code, data and various information 
   resources will be available throughout the weekend on cloud based 
   servers, for collaboration and sharing. </p>
  <p>What will you help us make?!</p>

        <h2>Hack for Change 2015: Principles for 21st Century Government<br><small>April 2015</small></h2>
  <img src="imgs/news/21centPrinciples.png" class="newsImgRight">
  
  
  <p>The compass points for this year's National Day of Civic Hacking are the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/" target="_blank">Principles for 21st Century Government</a>.
   These are key principles that Code for America, and Code for 
   Tampa Bay Brigade, believe are critical for governments of any 
   size, structure, or political persuasion in serving their communities 
   effectively.  You can read the principles in detail at Code for 
   America's website, but they're essentially common sense guidelines for 
   open, inclusive, accessible and efficient governance.</p>
  <p>It can be a little challenging for people to get their minds around 
   just what a "hackathon," or in Hillsborough County's case, a "codathon" 
   really is.   They sound trendy and clever, and fun.  
   But a good hackathon - and especially a good National Day of Civic 
   Hacking event - is more than just a techy social statement.  
   Coding events like <a href="http://hackforchange.org/events/tampa-fl-national-day/" target="_blank">Code for Hillsborough</a> are opportunities to make important and positive impact on our community.</p>
  <p>These events offer unique opportunities to employ - for the price of 
   food, t-shirts and swag - some amazing and often very expensive skill 
   sets and sophisticated knowledge base in a volunteer capacity to 
   solve real problems. In the <a href="https://hackathon.guide/" target="_blank">Hackathon Guide</a>, by <strong> Joshua Tauberer</strong>. Tauberer defines a hackathon as any event of any duration where people come together to solve problems. Good hackathons, he says:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Strengthen the community that the hackathon is for.</li>
   <li>Are welcoming to newcomers to the community.</li>
   <li>Provide an opportunity for participants to learn something new.</li>
   <li>Provide a space and a time for participants to make headway on problems they are interested in.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>And the best projects should be:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Clearly articulated.</li>
   <li>Attainable.</li>
   <li>Easy to onboard newcomers.</li>
   <li>Led by a stakeholder.</li>
   <li>Organized. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>It takes some practice and a lot of collaboration to build a good 
   coding event, and now in it's 3rd year, Hillsborough County is clearly 
   on its way. Working together with commuity and local 
   government stakeholders we believe we're creating a good event, in 
   alignment with Principles of 21st Century Government, with 
   potential projects that meet the criteria Tauberer suggests.</p>
  <p>Some of the potential projects on tap for our June 6 &amp; 7 event:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>A statewide <a href="http://codeformia.tumblr.com/post/119358078347/ndoch-statewide-civic-hacking-challenge" target="_blank">Florida Vendor Payments data challenge</a></li>
   <li>9-1-1 Education App for children </li>
   <li>Tampa area Traffic Forecasting app</li>
   <li>Entrepreneur Collaborative Center service app </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Plus <a href="http://hackforchange.org/challenges/" target="_blank">National Day Challenges</a> like <a href="http://hackforchange.org/challenges/local-digital-services-census/" target="_blank">Local Digital Services Census</a><strong> . </strong></p>
  <p>Principles for 21st Century Government give us a great road map for 
   plotting the way forward, and events like Code for Hillsborough give us a
   powerful vehicle for getting there! Join us June 5-7 to 
   help make Hillsborough better!</p>

  <h2>Why Participate in Code for Hillsborough?<br><small>April 2015</small></h2>
  
  <img src="imgs/news/Should_I.png" class="newsImgLeft">
  <p> "<em>Democratic
   societies progress by democratic means - that is, when citizens 
  participate fully and fairly in public life, working for the common good</em>." Paul Loeb, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/111901.Soul_of_a_Citizen">Soul of a Citizen</a></span></p>
  <p>If you're a programmer by trade or interest, seeing something called <a href="http://hackforchange.org/events/tampa-fl-national-day/">Code for Hillsborough</a> that's part of something</a> else called <a href="http://hackforchange.org/">National Day of Civic Hacking</a>,
   that promises food, t-shirts and swag, probably sounds like a done 
   deal! If you're not a programmer though, you may wonder what's in 
   it for you (besides food, t-shirts and swag) and why you should be 
  involved.</span></p>
  <p>Well, the fact is that 
   without everybody who's not a programmer sharing their ideas 
   and insights about community challenges they encounter everyday, there 
   wouldn't be a whole lot for the coders to do. Sure, they have 
   ideas for improvement and they certainly have the skills and expertise 
   to make those improvements happen - but these are whole brain problems 
   that require whole brain solutions; essentially, the skills and types of
   thinking that writers, artists, business people, social workers, 
   teachers, students, scientists, laborers, doctors, 
   tradespeople AND programmers bring to the table. </p>
  <h3>What it is</h3>
  <p>Code for Hillsborough is one of nearly 100 National Day of 
   Civic Hacking events going on throughout the country the weekend of June 6.  The national event has a very simple, straightforward mission: "<em>To improve our communities and the governments that serve them.</em>"  Organized by <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>,
   of which Code for Tampa Bay Brigade is a part, with support from 
   NASA and SecondMuse, the overarching goal of National Day of Civic 
   Hacking is for residents, community groups, and government to 
   collaborate to make their communities stronger.</p>
  <p>Now the super awesome cool thing about this idea is that it's a 
   collaborative notion shared by the governments of the communities that 
   are hosting these events! In an era of political bottlenecks and 
   ideological logjams, the idea that citizens and governments can 
   work together for the good of both should be cause for celebration by 
   one and all. </p>
  <h3>How it Works</h3>
  <p>Our
   two day event invites citizens from throughout Hillsborough County to 
   join with developers, coders, government staff and community
   organizers, to tackle a number of potential projects put forth by 
   the county, local citizens, and Code for America.  The general 
   project themes are transportation, an emergency services educational app
   for youth, and some community mapping efforts, among others.  
   Those who aren't programmers help articulate ideas, designs and 
   pathways to solutions that participating coders can develop into actual 
   frameworks</p>
  <p>We'll publish the final event schedule soon, but generally speaking, Code for Hillsborough will work like this:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>We'll kick things off Friday, June 5, at 4pm</strong>, with a meet and greet and a social hour. </li>
   <li><strong>Then we'll meet up Saturday, June 6, at Microsoft, at 9:30 for breakfast</strong> and a look at potential projects, break up into affinity teams and get 
    to work! There's breaks for lunch, and dinner, with lots of 
    opportunity for brainstorming and collaboration throughout. 
    Saturday we're also welcoming youth coders interested in helping 
    out with the 9-1-1 educational app, to spend the day, work on that 
    project or others they may be interested in, and spend some quality time
    with professional coders and others in the business community. 
    Work continues through 11pm.</li>
   <li><strong>We reconvene at 9:30am Sunday, June 7, for breakfast, work to lunch and wrap up projects around 3pm.</strong> Teams then present their applications and solutions before a 
    panel of judges from the business community and county, prizes will be 
    awarded and we end the weekend with the satisfaction of having come 
    together to make our community a better place. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Why it Matters</h3>
  <p>Some of the projects we'll work on will become long term projects for
   Code for Tampa Bay Brigade and other groups. Some may be adopted 
   by the county for further development, to become resources and tools 
   from which citizens can benefit. And every moment spent together 
   as citizens and government working for the common good, will be well 
   spent.</p>

      <h2>Code for Tampa Bay Brigade: A Look Back, the Journey Forward<br><small>Feb 2015</small></h2>
 

  <p>Code
   for Tampa Bay has had an interesting journey over the past year 
   and a half. As we move into 2015 with a dedicated and 
   visionary core group of members, projects underway and plans for <a href="http://hackforchange.org/">National Day of Civic Hacking</a> on the calendar for the summer, it seems like a good time to look at where we've been and where we hope to be going.</p>
  <p>At our March meeting this week, several members shared why they
   were there, at 6pm on a Monday, after a long day of work or school. 
   Gathered around the Media:scape collaborative work station, at the
   awesome <a href="http://www.hcplc.org/hcplc/locations/hve/" target="_blank">Hive at John F. Germany Library</a>,
   Tampa's beautiful public makerspace, they spoke of wanting to create 
   solutions instead of complain about problems, about the opportunity <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/" target="_blank">Code for America</a> involvement gives us to be active and engaged citizens.  Voting, they agreed, gives us a voice. <em>Coding
   for Tampa Bay, they said, gives us the ability to physically make a 
   difference, to be civic partners with government and citizens, to build 
   bridges instead of walls.</em></p>
  <p>And that, in a nutshell, is what Code for America is all about, and what Code for Tampa Bay Brigade exists to accomplish.</p>
  <h3>In the Beginning</h3>
  <p>Code for Tampa Bay Brigade got its start in November 2013, as Code 
   for Tampa, with two members who were excited about the possibilities 
   inherent in a Code for American group
   here in the Tampa area. The Hive was just getting started, and 
   was then known as the Community Innovation Center, and the CfT group 
   looked like a natural fit in a public makerspace. </p>
  <p>But it proved a little challenging to get others on board. 
   Initial interest turned out to be private sector groups with 
   personal agendas who thought Code for Tampa was a convenient way to
   get free programming solutions .  One apparent early adopter was 
   even on a phone call with local organizers and Code for America, but 
   then failed to show for subsequent meetings.  Local 
   government contacts seemed interested, as well, but never made meetings,
   or fully engaged at this early stage.  Another potential partner 
   persuaded us to change our name to Code for Hillsborough, with the 
   thought that we'd get more buy in from local government that way, and 
   then that partner disappeared.</p>
  <p>We
   just kept meeting, two or three of us, attending the local National Day
   of Civic Hacking event in the summer of 2014 as Code for Hillsborough. 
   And all the time, Code for America stood by us, patiently guiding and 
   supporting. </p>
  
  <h3>Turning the Corner</h3>
  <p>By fall of 2014, we'd picked up a couple more new members, enough to strengthen our core team, updated our <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B99kcFct-I-MSGE1Vmw2Q2lCekk&amp;authuser=0" target="_blank">Community Profile</a> and decided there was more to be gained with a more inclusive name, better representative of what we hoped to achieve, and we were reborn as Code for Tampa Bay. </p>
  <p>And we kept meeting: now four or five smart, dedicated 
   people willing to wait it out; a Red Hat sales director with a 
   commitment to the open source movement, a local resident
   and his son, interested in prison reform and learning about civic 
   coding and it's potential to improve social issues; a young local 
   software developer, a writer. We launched our website, started a 
   localwiki that we debuted at the November 15 Grand Opening of the Hive.</p>
  <p>After meeting a few more milestones, we qualified for free <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Tampa-Bay-Brigade/" target="_blank">MeetUp</a> membership with Code for America support, and that made all the 
   difference. as more people with interests in coding and civic engagement
   began to find us. We applied for a Hillsborough County Economic 
   Development Innovation Initiative (EDI2) grant to host a National Day of
   Civic Hacking event in the summer, reaching out to past organizers, and
   now we were a presence.</p>
  <p>Potential partners came and went - and we kept meeting..</p>
  <h3>New Year, Fresh Energy</h3>
  <p>In early 2015, another new public space opened up in Hillsborough 
   County, the Entrepreneur Collaborative Center (ECC), and they welcomed 
   us there as well. IT staff from Hillsborough County began coming 
   to meetings.  An energetic local coder took it upon himself to do a
   demonstration of data organizing, using GIS subsidence data from 
   the Florida US Geological Survey, and now we had an educational 
   component, as well as an actual project. </p>
  <p>We held our February meeting at the ECC, as part of Tampa Bay Startup
   Week and about 15 people attended.  Our Twitter page began 
   garnering new followers, our MeetUp page membership pushed past 50. </p>
  <p>At our March meeting, we were joined by IT staff from the City of 
   Tampa, who had been encouraged to attend by supervisors, just as our 
   Hillsborough County IT staff member had been, and now we have 
   representation from both the County and City, and a solid core of 
   Brigade members with a variety of skills and interests who are 
   actively interested in positive community engagement, who believe in the
   power of collaboration between government and citizens to make things 
   better for both.</p>
  <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
  <p>The lesson we bring from our first year and a half is this: <strong><em>Play the <a href="http://eurekafactory.net/2014/06/02/the-patience-to-succeed-playing-the-long-game/" target="_blank">Long Game</a>. </em> </strong>Things
   of worth and meaning take time. Building community takes time. 
   Making positive change takes at least as much time, if not more 
   time, than it took to create negative situations.  Slow and 
   steady, if it doesn't always win the race, keeps you on the journey. </p>
  <p>So we will continue to meet, gathering <strong>the first Monday of each month at the Hive at John F. Germany Public Library</strong>,
   and we will keep the conversation going, the bridge building going, 
   the light on for transparency and openness in our communities at 
   all levels, and the door open to anyone who wants to join us to help 
   make Tampa Bay better for all of us.</p>
  <p>If you want to be part of our civic engagement group, join up 
   at Meetup page, and follow along on Twitter and Facebook.  And if 
   you're in the Tampa Bay area and are aware of a problem or challenge in 
   your community that you have an idea for solving, or would like to bring
   to our attention, please share your thoughts on our <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/TOjVa0U4oJ" target="_blank">Code for Tampa Bay Brigade Projects form.</a></p>
  <p><em>Code for Tampa Bay Brigade - Coding for the Greater Good</em></p>
  <p>In celebration of <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/events/codeacross-2015/">CodeAcross 2015</a>, and to help kick off<a href="http://tampa.startupweek.co/">Tampa Bay StartUp Week</a>, and we're partnering with the <a href="http://www.83degreesmedia.com/features/entrepreneur120914.aspx" target="_blank">Mark Sharpe Entrepreneur Collaborative Center</a> (ECC) in Tampa &amp; the <a href="http://theironyard.com/locations/tampa-st-petersburg/">Iron Yard</a> in St. Petersburg for this month's Code for Tampa Bay Meet Up, on Monday, February 2nd at 6pm at the ECC!</p>
  <p>CodeAcross is officially held Feb. 20-22, marking a weekend of civic hacking events hosted by nodes of the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/" target="_blank">Code for America</a> network around the world. It is timed to coincide with both the last weekend of the Code for America Fellows residency and<a href="http://opendataday.org/">International Open Data Day</a>.
   The goal of CodeAcross is to activate the Code for America network and 
   inspire residents everywhere to get actively involved in their 
   community. The theme for CodeAcross 2015 is <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/">Principles for 21st Century Government</a></p>
  <p>Together with Iron Yard St. Pete, we'll be welcoming guests and new 
   members, taking a look at the Principles for 21st Century Government and
   how they might apply in our community, and finishing our GIS Data 
   journey that Jeremy White started us on, taking the data he showed us 
   how to clean up, and converting it into a web based resource for ease of
   use and application, via Rails and Javascript.</p>
  <p>Like <a href="http://www.hcplc.org/hcplc/locations/hve/" target="_blank">the Hive</a>,
   where we also meet, the ECC is a community gem: 8,000 
   square feet of shared space, providing traditional Small Business 
   Information Center services, and serving as a place for community 
   partners and local entrepreneurs to comingle and collaborate. It's a fitting place to bring together citizens and government in 
   open collaboration for the benefit of all.</p>
  <p>It's great to be part of the growing and increasingly 
   collaborative tech and business community in Tampa Bay, and we're 
   excited about all the opportunities for open government and robust 
   economic development that working together on both sides of the Bay 
   makes possible!</p>
  <p>Tampa Bay Startup Week is, at heart, a "reflection of 
   our community's unique entrepreneurial identity." We don't 
   have to "be like" Silicon Valley, or Chattanooga, or any of the other 
   great places putting their own industrious stamp of identity on 
   their communities. We're Tampa Bay! And we can build together on 
   all the resources and skills that make us strong and competitive 
   economically, and also make us caring and compassionate communities for 
   all our residents.</p>

      <h2>Code for Tampa Bay On the Way!<br><small>Jan 2015</small></h2>
        
        
  <p>Many
   thanks to Jeremy White for his great first hand look at cleaning up 
   data (GIS data, in this case) with Python. It was really interesting and
   shed a lot of light on the many facets of organizing data. 
   Thanks, too, to Sean, from Hillsborough Count IT, for looking
   into ways we can collaborate with the county, and for being so 
   welcoming and supportive
   to our young Brigade. We're looking forward to becoming a resource both
   our community and local government can count on.</p>
  <p>We also enjoyed some good discussion about some of the inherent 
   challenges of different types of data sets, from how they're used to how
   they're interpreted, and how to make things more accessible and usable 
   for a variety of needs.</p>
  <p>Next month, Jeremy will walk us through creating a web app for the 
   GIS data, with Rails and Javascript. We're hoping to hold our February 
   meeting at the new Entrepreneurship Collaborative Center in Ybor City.</p>

      <h2>Happy Holidays and an Open New Year from Code for Tampa Bay Brigade!<br><small>Dec 2014</small></h2>
      
      <img src="imgs/news/C4H_01.jpg" class="newsImgLeft">
  <p>We
   hope your holidays are happy ones, and that 2015 is bright and 
   promising for you and yours! We're excited about the New Year, and
   look forward to working together with our collaborative partners and 
   community volunteers to help make Tampa Bay better, brighter and more 
   transparent for all.</p>
  <p>We hope you'll join us at one of our upcoming meetings - the next one is January 5 at the <a href="http://www.hcplc.org/hcplc/locations/hve/" target="_blank">Hive Community Innovation Center</a> (RSVP at our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Tampa-Bay-Brigade" target="_blank">MeetUp page</a>) And in February, we're going to try meeting at the new <a href="http://tbo.com/news/business/new-improved-center-nurtures-small-business-20141211/" target="_blank">Mark Sharpe Entrepeneur Collaborative Center</a>, where we hope to help host the 2015 Hillsborough Hackathon, for which we're grateful to have received a <strong>Hillsborough County EDI2 grant</strong>.</p>
  <p>Thank you very very much to our great core group of Brigade organizers:</p>
  <p>Co-captain <strong>John Punzak</strong>, of Red Hat; the <strong>Phil Muinos</strong> -there's two of them, Jr. &amp; Sr.for providing storytelling support - and <strong>Chris Willingham</strong>, a programmer at SourceToad, our delivery lead who made our website possible and manages our projects.</p>
  <p>And very special thanks to <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/" target="_blank">Code for America</a>, for their neverending support and encouragement along our sometimes halting journey to Brigadehood.</p>
  
  <p>We
   were recently asked, along with other Brigades, to share our 2014
   story, including any lessons learned, warts and all, and not to leave 
   out failure. We're glad they asked about failure, because real success 
   isn't possible without it.</p>
  <p>We're great at failure! Or at least near failure - let's call it 
   periodic fainting spells, mild swooning, occasional light 
   headedness.</p>
  <p>The biggest lesson we learned in our inaugural year is the <em><strong>power of perseverance</strong></em>;
   get a fainting couch for those weak moments, rest a spell, then get up 
   and try again. If you believe in the value of Code for America for
   your community - and we deeply do - then you have to be prepared to 
   play the long game. This is especially true if your community is new to 
   the idea of open government, and startles easily when someone asks for 
   data.</p>
  <p>In
   less than one year, we went through three name changes trying to find 
   our place and our voice, suffered the loss of a major nonprofit 
   partner afflicted by mission creep, and experienced the challenge of 
   helping the local community and municipal partners understand what Code 
   for America is and how it can help our community - and came out strong, 
   vibrant and viable.</p>
  <p>We now have grant support from Hillsborough County for <strong>Hack Tampa Bay 2015</strong>, two great meeting spaces, a location for our <a href="http://hackforchange.org/" target="_blank">2015 National Day of Civic Hacking</a> event and collaborators with whom to host it, and a strong relationship with our municipal partners.</p>
  <p>We'll probably have more fainting spells in the coming year, but we 
   know now that we can keep moving forward, that slow and steady wins the 
   race - although it's not really a race; it's a steady way of being 
   that's inclusive, open, forward looking and always ready to help make 
   our community better.</p>
